These questions are intended to test a DS / MLE's ability to design end-to-end systems.

## Recommendation system
* You are tasked with designing a recommendation system for a large e-commerce platform like Amazon. How would you provide personalized recommendations to millions of users? 
  * Things to look for / consider: Data storage, recommendation algorithms, scalability, updates to data

## ML Pipeline
* You're leading a project to build a machine learning pipeline for processing and anlayzing large volume of data generated by financial transactions. How would you architect the system to handle data ingestion, preprocessing, model training & inference at sacle? 
  * Look for: Technologies & frameworks used, practices utilized to ensure reliability and efficiency of the pipeline
* How would you deplpoy a machine learning model into production?
  * Look for: Architecture for serving the model, monitoring performance, rolling out new versions, feedback loop for ensuring performance and reliability of deployed models, A/B testing, model versioning
