## Recent project discussion (in the last 1-2 years)
* Can you walk me through a recent machine laerning project that you worked on?
* What was the problem you were solving?
* What technologies and techniques did you use?
  * What other techniques did you consider but discard? / Why were these the right choices?
* What was the outcome? 
  * How did your choice of technologies / techniques impact the outcome?
* Retrospective: What would you do differently knowing what you do now?

## Technical knowledge assessment
* Explain supervised and unsupervised learning, providing real-world applications for each.
* How do you handle missing data in a dataset? Can you discuss different imputation techniques?
* What are the steps involved in building a recommendation system? Can you explain how collaborative filtering works?

## Problem solving and Domain specific knowledge
* Given a dataset with millions of records and you need to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights. What steps would you take to conduct it efficiently?
* How would you deploy a machine learning model into production, ensuring performance and scalability?
